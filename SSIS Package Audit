Below is a T-SQL Script:
SELECT  
	ssisp.name AS package_name
	,ssisp.description
	,ssispf.foldername as folder_name
	,CASE ssisp.packagetype
		WHEN 0 THEN 'Default client'
		WHEN 1 THEN 'I/O Wizard'
		WHEN 2 THEN 'DTS Designer'
		WHEN 3 THEN 'Replication'
		WHEN 5 THEN 'SSIS Designer'
		WHEN 6 THEN 'Maintenance Plan'
	ELSE 'Unknown'
	END AS package_type
	,c.name AS owner_name 
	,ssisp.createdate AS create_date 
	,DATALENGTH(ssisp.packagedata) AS package_size
FROM msdb.dbo.sysssispackages AS ssisp 
INNER JOIN msdb.dbo.sysssispackagefolders AS ssispf
	ON ssisp.folderid = ssispf.folderid
INNER JOIN sys.syslogins AS c 
	ON ssisp.ownersid = c.sid
ORDER BY ssisp.name

SQL Server 2012, provide two system tables in MSDB database those can be used to answer our question.
1.  [dbo].[sysssispackages]
2.  [dbo].[sysssispackagefolders]

Dbo.sysssispackages table will provide information about SSIS Package such as name, description,package createdate, foloderid (so we can join with sysssispackagefolders to get folder name) and other columns.

Dbo.sysssispackagefolder will provide us the folder name, folderid and parentfolderid. We can join above tables and get Packages with Folder information.

SELECT f.foldername            AS FolderName,
       p.name                  AS PackageName,
       p.description           AS [Description],
       P.createdate            AS PackageCreateDate,
       Suser_sname(p.ownersid) AS OwnerName,
       CASE
         WHEN p.isencrypted = 0 THEN 'N'
         ELSE 'Y'
       END                     AS [IsEncrypted]
FROM   [dbo].[sysssispackages] p
       INNER JOIN [dbo].[sysssispackagefolders] f
               ON p.folderid = f.folderid
